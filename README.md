This project aims to classify vehicles into emission categories based on features such as engine size, fuel type, and CO2 emissions using machine learning.

## 📁 Files Included

- vehicle_emissions.csv – The dataset used for training and testing.
- emission_classification.ipynb – Jupyter notebook containing the code.
- report.pdf – Full report with methodology, code, output, and conclusion.
- README.md – Project overview and instructions.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Predict Air Quality Level:
Classify air pollution levels based on environmental features such as PM2.5, NO2, and temperature.


## 🛠 Methodology

1.	Data Collection: Gathered environmental data containing parameters like PM2.5, NO2, and temperature.
2.	Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized the dataset. Categorical encoding and handling of missing values were performed.
3.	Model Building: A classification model (e.g., Random Forest or SVM) was trained to classify the air quality level.
4.	Model Evaluation: Utilized confusion matrices with heat maps and calculated metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
5.	Tools Used: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.


## ✅ Results

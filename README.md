# 03_Predict-Air-Quality-Level_202401100400003
This project successfully demonstrated the classification of air quality levels using environmental features such as PM2.5, NO2, and temperature. By employing machine learning techniques, we were able to develop a reliable predictive model with strong accuracy and performance metrics. The use of heatmaps for confusion matrices and detailed classification reports provided valuable insights into model behavior and class-wise performance.

Such predictive systems can aid policymakers, researchers, and the public in understanding pollution trends and making informed decisions. Future work can involve incorporating more environmental variables, real-time data streams, and exploring deep learning models for enhanced accuracy.
